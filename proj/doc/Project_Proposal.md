## Desired Functionalities
We are making our version of the classic game ‘Space Invaders’.
Ideally, our game would have a Start Menu, which would include a leader board, ‘How to Play’ instructions and the Start Game option.
Regarding gameplay, the player uses the keyboard to move the cannon and the mouse to shoot the invaders, while being defended by the bunkers. As the game goes on, depending on the user’s performance, the score will oscillate.
Special features such as the ‘Mystery Ship’ are included.

## Devices
 - Keyboard – Read user input, in this case, arrow keys (to move the cannon).
 - Video Card – To make the Game viewable to the User.
 - Timer – The velocity of the invader ships is timed and incremental. The closer to the surface, the faster they are.
 - Mouse – Menu and too make the cannon shoot.
 
## Workplan
 
 - *Week 1* (15-21 May) – Make the Menu (Leader board and How to Play). Create the graphics for the gameplay (design the little spaceships and such)
 - *Week 2* (22-28 May) – Work on the invading spaceships’ movement and attacks.
 - *Week 3* (29 May - 4 Jun) – Work on the cannon’s movement, attacks, and defensive barriers. Join the invaders and the cannon.
 - *Week 4* (4-9 Jun) – Make the two parts interact with each other (make attacks consequential).
